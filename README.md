NYC Taxi tip prediction
==============================

In this repository you will find a project that analyses a dataset from 
NYC Yellow Taxi Data. 

- First we explore the dataset and we prepare the data (notebooks/data_exploration_cleaning.ipynb)
- Then we analyse trends in the dataset (notebooks/data_summary.ipynb)
- Finally, we create a first model to test the possibility to predict the tip amount (notebooks/data_modeling.ipynb)
